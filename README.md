JSONtools
=========

What is it?
-----------
JSONtools can parse Java String to JSON(JavaScript Object Notation), which is a lightweight, data interchange format, and it can covert a JSON back to String.

JSON is built on two structures: array or objects. Array begins with '[' (left bracket) and ends with ']' (right bracket). It's an ordered collection of values, and each value is separated by ',' (comma). Object begins with '{' (left brace) and ends '}' (right brace). It stores pairs of key and values. Each key is followed by ':', and each pair is separated by ',' (comma). 

A value can be a String in double quotation, an array, an object, a number, true, false or null.
