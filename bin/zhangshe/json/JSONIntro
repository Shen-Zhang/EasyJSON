JSONArray:
	A value can be a string in double quotes, or a number, or true or false or null, or an object or an 
	array. These structures can be nested.
JSONObject:
	An array is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with '[' (left bracket) and ends with ']' 
	(right bracket). Values are separated by , (comma).
JSONString: 
	A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped in double quotes, using backslash 
	escapes. A character is represented as a single character string. 
JSONReal:
	A real is very much like a C or Java number, except that the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used.
JSONConstant:
	null, true or false.
